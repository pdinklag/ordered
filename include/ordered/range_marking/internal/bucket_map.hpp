 * \brief Associative range-marking bucket
 * 
 * A bucket contains marks for a certain key range, stored in a bit vector.
 * Insertion and deletion involves setting or clearing a bit, respectively.
 * Queries are answered using linear scans over the bits.
 * Values are stored in a simple array.
 * 
 * \tparam Key_ the type
 * \tparam Value_ the value type
 * \tparam capacity_ the bucket capacity; must be a power of two
